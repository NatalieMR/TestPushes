## A Repository to Keep Track of My Trials While I Figure Out GitHub

This repository will have lots of generic commands and "mistakes", so I can learn as I go. It's organized in a very stream of consciousness kind of way, but I will try to keep it organized for your sake, and mine. Feel free to peruse my trial and error processes, but don't judge!
